The original source of the lncRNA and mRNA expression data is from the data generated in the Du, Z. et al. 2013 paper (Du, Z. et al. (2013) Integrative genomic analyses reveal clinically relevant long noncoding RNAs in human cancer. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 20, 908-13.). The link of the source is freely available (http://cistrome.org/lncRNA/lncRNA_data_repository.html).
